NK cells also produce TNF-a, granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the chemokines CCL3 (MIF 1-a), CCL4, and CCL5 (RANTES), which act to recruit and activate macrophages.; 233: Gene expression of the classical MHC class II proteins, along with the invariant-chain, DMa, DM\u00df, and DOa, but not DO\u00df, is coordinately increased by IFN-<U+03B3>, which is produced by activated TH1 cells, CD8 T cells, and NK cells.; 666: Inflammation causes increased vascular permeability, and the site becomes heavily infiltrated by TH17 and TH1 effector CD4 T cells, which produce IL-17, IFN-<U+03B3>, and GM-CSF. Cytokines and chemokines produced by these effector T cells in turn recruit and activate myeloid cells that exacerbate inflammation, resulting in further recruitment of T cells, B cells, and innate immune cells to the lesion. Autoreactive B cells produce autoantibodies against myelin antigens with help from T cells.; 363: Activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells through TLR-9 induces the expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L or CD154), a TNF-family transmembrane cytokine, which binds to CD40, a TNF-family receptor that is expressed by  activated conventional dendritic cells. This interaction enables conventional dendritic cells to sustain production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12, strengthening the IL-12-induced production of IFN-<U+03B3> by T cells.; 363: Normally, IL-12 made by conventional dendritic cells induces CD4 T cells to produce abundant IFN-<U+03B3>, which helps macrophages kill the bacteria.; 366: For example, as discussed in Chapter 11, by presenting antigens of ingested pathogens, macrophages recruit help from IFN-<U+03B3>-producing CD4 T cells to augment their intracellular killing of these pathogens.; 373: TH1 cells (first panels) produce cytokines, such as IFn-<U+03B3>, which activate macrophages, enabling them to destroy intracellular microorganisms more efficiently.; 373: TH1 cells are characterized by the production of IFN-<U+03B3>, whereas TH2 cells are characterized by the production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.; 374: If a TH1 cell recognizes bacterial antigens displayed on the surface of an infected macrophage, it will activate the macrophage further through the release of IFN-<U+03B3>, which enhances the macrophage\u2019s microbicidal activity to kill ingested bacteria.; 375: Finally, TH1 cells themselves may provide IFN-<U+03B3>, thus reinforcing the signal for the differentiation of more TH1 cells through a positive feedback loop.; 376: Similar to the positive feedback for TH1 cell development provided by IFN-<U+03B3> produced by activated TH1 cells, IL-4 produced by activated TH2 cells may amplify TH2 development from naive T-cell precursors.; 377: For example, both IFN-<U+03B3> (produced by TH1 cells) and IL-4 (produced by TH2 cells) potently inhibit TH17 development, promoting TH1 or TH2 development, respectively (Fig. 9.34).; 377: Conversely, IFN-<U+03B3>, a product of TH1 cells, can inhibit the proliferation of TH2 cells (see Fig. 9.34).; 377: TH1 cells generate copious amounts of IFN-<U+03B3> when they recognize antigen on a target cell, thus reinforcing the signal for the differentiation of more TH1 cells through a positive feedback loop.; 378: Activated TH1 cells secrete IFN-g; 378: IFn-<U+03B3> produced by TH1 cells blocks the growth of TH2 cells (right panels).; 384: TH1 cells are specialized to activate macrophages that are infected by or have ingested pathogens; they secrete IFn-<U+03B3> to activate the infected cell, as well as other effector molecules.; 385: Table Figure 9.4; 635: Figure 14.25; 457: Figure 11.9; 458: When an effector TH1 cell specific for a bacterial peptide contacts an infected macrophage, the T cell is induced to secrete the macrophage-activating factor IFN-<U+03B3> and to express CD40 ligand.

In the presence of an invading parasite, dendritic cells taking up antigens in these tissues migrate to regional lymph nodes, where they tend to drive antigen-specific naive CD4 T cells to become effector TH2 cells. TH2 cells themselves secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, thus maintaining an environment in which further differentiation of TH2 cells is favored.

SHIP dephosphorylates PIP3 in the plasma membrane, generating PIP2. PH domain-containing enzymes, such as Vav, Btk, and PLC-<U+03B3>, depend on their PH domain binding to PIP3 for their stable recruitment to the activated B-cell receptor complex.

It is triggered by the binding of antigen to IgE antibodies bound to the high-affinity IgE receptor FceRI on mast cells and basophils.  Mast cells are strategically distributed beneath the mucosal surfaces of the body and in connective tissue.; 433: Table Figure 10.38; 435: Cross-linking by antigen of IgE bound to the high-affinity FceRI on mast cells and basophils also results in exocytosis of their granule contents, as we describe below.; 437: Mast cells are large cells found in connective tissue and can be distinguished by their secretory granules, which contain many inflammatory mediators. They bind stably to monomeric IgE antibodies through the very high-affinity receptor FceRI. Antigen cross-linking of the bound IgE antibody molecules triggers rapid degranulation, releasing inflammatory mediators into the surrounding tissue. These mediators trigger local inflammation, which recruits cells and proteins required for host defense to sites of infection. These cells are also triggered during allergic reactions when allergens bind to IgE on mast cells.; 270: The Fce receptor (FceRI) is found on mast cells and basophils. The a subunit binds to IgE antibodies with very high affinity. The \u00df subunit is a four-spanning transmembrane protein.

It also recruits TH2 cells, which can then mount a local type 2 cellular response.; 614: Mast cells express FceRI constitutively on their surface and are activated when antigens cross-link IgE bound to these receptors (see Fig. 10.43).

These homodimeric members of the immunoglobulin superfamily are found exclusively on the surfaces of cells, such as dendritic cells, that stimulate naive T-cell proliferation (see Section 9-8).

This exogenous pathway of loading MHC class I molecules is called cross-presentation, and is carried out very efficiently by some specialized types of dendritic cells (Fig. 6.3). The activation of naive T cells by this pathway is called cross-priming.; 470: Figure 11.21; 372: CD40 ligand binds CD40 on the dendritic cell, delivering an additional signal that increases the expression of B7 and 4-1BBL by the dendritic cell, which in turn provides additional co-stimulation to the naive CD8 T cell.; 470: Licensing involves the induction of co-stimulatory molecules such as B7, CD40, and 4-1BBL on the dendritic cell, which can then deliver signals that fully activate naive CD8 T cells (see Fig. 9.29).; 362: By the time activated dendritic cells arrive within lymphoid tissues, they are no longer able to engulf antigens by phagocytosis or macropinocytosis. They instead express very high levels of long-lived MHC class I and MHC class II molecules, which enable them to stably present peptides from pathogens already taken up and processed. Of equal importance, they express high levels of co-stimulatory molecules on their surface. There are two main co-stimulatory molecules: the structurally related transmembrane glycoproteins B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), which deliver co-stimulatory signals by interacting with receptors on naive T cells (see Section 7-21).; 393-394: In most cases, the antigen-presenting cells responsible for activating naive T cells, and inducing their clonal expansion, are conventional dendritic cells that express the co-stimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2.; 359: Viral proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm of dendritic cells are processed in the proteasome and presented on the cell surface as peptides loaded onto MHC class I molecules after transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, as in any other type of virus-infected cell (see Chapter 6).This enables dendritic cells to present antigen to and activate naive CD8 T cells, which then differentiate into cytotoxic effector CD8 T cells that recognize and kill any virus-infected cell.; 470: Left panels: naive CD8 T cells that encounter peptide:MHC class I complexes on the surface of dendritic cells expressing high levels of co-stimulatory molecules as a result of the inflammatory environment produced by some pathogens (upper left panel) are activated to proliferate in response, eventually differentiating into cytotoxic CD8 T cells (lower left panel).; 332: When the T-cell receptor of a mature naive T cell is strongly ligated by a peptide:MHC complex displayed on a specialized antigen-presenting cell in a peripheral lymphoid organ, the T cell is activated to proliferate and produce effector T cells.; 369: The initial encounter with specific antigen in the presence of a co-stimulatory signal triggers entry of the T cell into the G1 phase of the cell cycle; at the same time, it also induces the synthesis of IL-2 along with the a chain of the IL-2 receptor (also known as CD25).; 372: In some viral infections, dendritic cells become sufficiently activated to directly induce CD8 T cells to produce the IL-2 required for their differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells, without help from CD4 T cells.; 358: Dendritic cells take up, process, and present antigens from all types of sources, and are present mainly in the T-cell areas where they drive the initial clonal expansion and   differentiation of naive T cells into effector T cells.", "selected": false, "source": "80", "TargetReceptors": "41BB, CD27, CD28, CD40L, TCR", "shared_interaction": "Activate", "SourceReceptors": "41BBL, CD70, B7, CD40, MHCI, MHCII", "shared_name": "DC (Activate) T_CD8", "id": "407", "name": "DC (Activate) T_CD8"}}, {"selected": false, "data": {"ImmuneProcesses": "Allergic Inflammation, Type 2, Antiparasitic", "interaction": "Polarize", "target": "103", "SUID": 406, "JanewayReferences": "603: Figure 14.2; 604: Immune defenses against multicellular parasites are found mainly at the sites of parasite entry, namely, under the skin and in the mucosal tissues of the airways and the gut.

In the presence of an invading parasite, dendritic cells taking up antigens in these tissues migrate to regional lymph nodes, where they tend to drive antigen-specific naive CD4 T cells to become effector TH2 cells. TH2 cells themselves secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, thus maintaining an environment in which further differentiation of TH2 cells is favored.

Binding of the foreign-peptide:self MHC complex by the T-cell receptor and, in this example, a CD4 co-receptor transmits a signal (arrow 1) to the T cell that antigen has been encountered. effective activation of naive T cells requires a second signal (arrow 2), the co-stimulatory signal, to be delivered by the same antigen-presenting cell (APC).; 285: While naive T- and B-cell activation requires signaling through the antigen receptors on these cells, T-cell receptor or B-cell receptor signaling, respectively, is not sufficient to activate the cells. For naive T cells, an additional co-stimulatory signal is required and, as discussed above (see Sections 7-21 and 7-22), is frequently provided by the CD28 receptor.; 369: Co-stimulation through CD28 contributes to the production of IL-2 in at least three ways.; 370: The receptor CD40 on dendritic cells binds to CD40 ligand expressed on T cells, initiating two-way signaling that transmits activating signals to the T cell and also induces the dendritic cell to express increased B7, thus stimulating further T-cell proliferation.; 30: CD4 T cells recognize antigen presented by MHC class II proteins, which are expressed by the predominant antigen-presenting cells of the immune system: dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells; 166: The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules expressed by dendritic cells can function to activate naive CD4 T cells.; 216: For loading peptides onto MHC class II molecules, dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells are able to capture exogenous proteins via endocytic vesicles and through specific cell-surface receptors. For B cells, this process of antigen capture can include the B-cell receptor. The peptides that are derived from these proteins are loaded onto MHC class II molecules in specially modified endocytic compartments in these antigen-presenting cells, which we will discuss in more detail later. In dendritic cells, this pathway operates to activate naive CD4 T cells to become effector T cells.; 223: The immunological function of MHC class II molecules is to bind peptides generated in the intracellular vesicles of dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and to present these peptides to CD4 T cells. The purpose for this pathway is different for each cell type. Dendritic cells primarily are concerned with activating CD4 T cells, while macrophages and B cells are concerned with receiving various forms of help from these CD4 T cells.; 230: This means that by the time dendritic cells arrive at lymph nodes, they express peptides derived from the pathogens that activated them and have higher CD86 levels that provide signals for greater CD4 T-cell activation.; 362: By the time activated dendritic cells arrive within lymphoid tissues, they are no longer able to engulf antigens by phagocytosis or macropinocytosis. They instead express very high levels of long-lived MHC class I and MHC class II molecules, which enable them to stably present peptides from pathogens already taken up and processed. Of equal importance, they express high levels of co-stimulatory molecules on their surface. There are two main co-stimulatory molecules: the structurally related transmembrane glycoproteins B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), which deliver co-stimulatory signals by interacting with receptors on naive T cells (see Section 7-21).; 372: B7 expressed by the dendritic cell first activates the CD4 T cells to express IL-2 and CD40 ligand (see Sections 9-16 and 9-17).; 393-394: In most cases, the antigen-presenting cells responsible for activating naive T cells, and inducing their clonal expansion, are conventional dendritic cells that express the co-stimulatory molecules B7.1 and B7.2.; 332: When the T-cell receptor of a mature naive T cell is strongly ligated by a peptide:MHC complex displayed on a specialized antigen-presenting cell in a peripheral lymphoid organ, the T cell is activated to proliferate and produce effector T cells.; 359: The versatility in pathways for antigen uptake enables dendritic cells to present antigens from virtually any type of microbe, including fungi, parasites, viruses, and bacteria (Fig. 9.15).
